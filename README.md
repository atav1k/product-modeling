# Product Modeling
Product modeling establishes and enforces a process to capture user needs and derisk product development.

This is a list of potential things you'll want to consider when defining a product or feature. Usage is contingent on the scale and risk of the product or feature and the confidence in the user segment listed. This is a work in progress.

## General

### Problem and Value Proposition
- A strategic summary defining user pain points and how product features will deliver value to customers

### Success Metrics
- A list of organization or user metrics that will indicate increased value in user segments

### Roles
- Responsible
- Accountable
- Consulted
- Informed

## Value Proposition
Simplifies complex ideas into quickly readable illustrations with only the most practical, important details.

### Research Artifacts
- These can be interview quotes, usage statistics or competitor analysis to support prioritization or ideation efforts

### User Segment(s)
- Select the customer segment(s) to profile

### User Jobs
- Jobs describe the things your users are trying to get done, the tasks they are performing, the problems they face or the needs they have

### Pains & Gains
- Pains describe things that block or frustrate a user doing a job, describes risks or bad outcomes
- Gains describe the outcomes and benefits that users require, expect and want

### Product Features
- A list of stories that describe what features are offered, whether visible or invisible, and what job or need they solve

### Relievers & Returns
- Relievers describe how features alleviate pains described, especially extreme ones. Returns describe how features create customer value and outline relevant benefits

### Confidence & Risks
- Rate confidence in usage of features described and highlight level of technical risks involved   

## Design Sprint
- A timeboxed method to arrive at a shared vision that produces testable prototypes and other artifacts

### Understand
- Review past work
- Summarize goals & anti-goals
- Conduct customer interviews
- Moodboard existing solutions
- User flow

### Diverge
- Job stories
- Mind map
- Storyboard
- Critique
- Wireframes

### Converge
- Prioritize and vote
- Assumptions table
- Wireflow a prototype

### Prototype
- User recruiting
- Pre & post user survey
- Prototype build
- Validation board

### Testing
- User test interview
- Retrospective

### Conclusion
- Iteration
- Documentation
- Wireflow

## Development Sprint
Costing the artifacts from the discovery process to produce a tangible product in a reasonable timeframe.

### Feasibility
- Review past work
- Highlight impossibles & alternatives
- Answer technical risks

### Staging
- Propose development plan
